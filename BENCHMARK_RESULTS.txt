Benchmark Results Summary

Date: Sunday, November 30, 2025
System: Darwin (Mac)
Script: examples/benchmark_vmec.py
Input: src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/test_data/cth_like_free_bdy.json

--- Original Baseline (Before HandoverStorage Refactor) ---
Cold Start Average Time: 0.5946 s +/- 0.0021 s (Iterations: 488)
Hot Restart Average Time: 0.2438 s +/- 0.0177 s (Iterations: 174)
Details: Cold start averaged over 3 runs. Hot restart averaged over 5 runs.

--- Latest Results (After HandoverStorage Refactor and subsequent fixes) ---
Cold Start Average Time: 0.5865 s +/- 0.0057 s (Iterations: 488)
Hot Restart Average Time: 0.2311 s +/- 0.0006 s (Iterations: 174)
Details: Cold start averaged over 3 runs. Hot restart averaged over 5 runs.

--- Performance Comparison (Latest vs. Original Baseline) ---
Cold Start: Improved by ~1.36% (0.5946s -> 0.5865s)
Hot Restart: Improved by ~5.21% (0.2438s -> 0.2311s)

Note: All hot restart runs involved a 1% perturbation of magnetic field components (b_p, b_r, b_z).
The benchmark measures the full vmecpp.run call, including both the core solver and the NESTOR interface for free-boundary cases.
