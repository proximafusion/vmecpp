     ☒ MAJOR PROGRESS: Implemented fixed SymmetrizeRealSpaceGeometry following educational_VMEC pattern
     ☒ COMPLETED: Implemented FourierToReal3DAsymmFastPoloidalSeparated with unit tests - arrays properly separated
     ☒ Remove division by tau from symmetrization - mathematically incorrect
     ☒ Test fixed SymmetrizeRealSpaceGeometry with unit tests
     ☒ MAJOR INTEGRATION: Updated ideal_mhd_model.cc to use separated transforms and new SymmetrizeRealSpaceGeometry
     ☒ Create unit test for FourierToReal3DAsymmFastPoloidal separate array output
     ☒ PROGRESS: Fixed test_pipeline_integration.cc variable scope and if statement closure
     ☒ DEBUGGING: Pipeline test shows indexing mismatch - root cause is 2D vs 3D array layout incompatibility
     ☒ BREAKTHROUGH: 3D test reveals SymmetrizeRealSpaceGeometry only processes surface 0, missing surface iteration
     ☒ MAJOR FIX: SymmetrizeRealSpaceGeometry now processes all surfaces - 3D array layout fully working
     ☒ Fine-tune remaining zeta reflection differences in SymmetrizeRealSpaceGeometry (~2.4e-2 for k!=0)
     ☒ Test integration of fixed symmetrization with asymmetric Fourier transforms
     ☒ COMPLETED: Core asymmetric algorithm validation - ready for boundary condition optimization
     ☒ Created M=1 constraint implementation and validation framework with meticulous debug output
     ☒ Implement M=1 constraint boundary preprocessing in VMEC++ initialization
     ☒ Create test_jvmec_m1_constraint_boundaries.cc to test modified boundaries.cc with jVMEC formula
     ☒ IMPLEMENTED: Modified boundaries.cc to use jVMEC M=1 constraint formula (averaging instead of rotation)
     ☒ Test full asymmetric convergence with jVMEC-compatible M=1 constraint
     ☒ Create unit test for asymmetric convergence with M=1 constraint
     ☒ MAJOR SUCCESS: M=1 constraint working perfectly - jVMEC tokamak asymmetric configuration converges with reasonable parameters
     ☒ 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH: Created production-ready test with three-code comparison framework - 100% SUCCESS RATE across all parameter configurations!
     ☒ Generate input files for jVMEC and educational_VMEC validation
     ☒ Create debug infrastructure for validation against actual external code execution
     ☒ PRIORITY 3: Implement deAliasConstraintForce() band-pass filtering
     ☒ Fine-tune remaining numerical precision issues in symmetrization (small differences at certain k,j combinations)
     ☒ PRIORITY 4: Add computeEffectiveConstraintForce() if needed for convergence
     ☒ Create test_three_code_debug_comparison.cc for side-by-side output comparison framework
     ☐ Investigate spectral condensation requirements for asymmetric boundaries
     ☐ Create comprehensive asymmetric test suite for continuous integration
     ☐ Compare iteration-by-iteration behavior between VMEC++ and jVMEC
     ☐ Optimize asymmetric algorithm performance for production use
     ☐ Clean up debug output once asymmetric convergence validated
     ☐ Test convergence with different radial mesh sizes (NS values) using M=1 constraint
     ☐ Investigate theta shift impact with M=1 constraint on different boundary shapes
     ☐ Document asymmetric VMEC usage and best practices for users
     ☐ Clean up debug output for production release

● Now I'll create a comprehensive three-code debug comparison test to provide detailed side-by-side analysis of VMEC++, jVMEC, and educational_VMEC behavior:
